⚠️ Be careful when launching ⚠️ These accounts are very old, so when using certain GEOs or IPv6 proxies, they might get flagged. If you see this happening, adjust your settings: API version, proxy, User-Agent, and locale.
❗️❗️❗️AGAIN: The accounts are 100% valid. They have been resting for a year and are in perfect condition. Sessions were checked before restocking the store.
If they fail on your first login in InstAccountsManager, the issue isnot on my side. Ask the software developer why their software behaves this way. But also follow the recommendations above and adjust your settings. Even in this software, people successfully work with these accounts. rules !!!
you should use good ukraine ip not dirty one !!!!!!!
When you receive the account data, make sure to change the information immediately. These accounts are very good, so if any account gets suspended, it means the problem is on your end. You should use a clean IP, not a dirty one.
When you receive the account data, please log in right away. If you wait a week and then report a problem, I won t provide a replacement. It is better to check the account within 24 hours, or you wont be eligible for a replacement.
